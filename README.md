Hello

Move orcaData.json to build/out folder

Not gonna lie this isnt my most presentable work BUT it does calculate something :D.

Mathematically it should be pretty scalable implementation wise it would take a LONG time.

It was a fun excercise, let me know how far off the mark I am :).

To see the "trajectory" points change LOG_ENABLED to true, it will dump all logs so its probably best to leave it as false most often.
